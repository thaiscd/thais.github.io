		<h3>Automated Design of Modular Manipulators from high-level task description</h3>
			<p>
			In this project, we developed an end-to-end system for
			automatically synthesizing correct-by-construction structure and
			controls for modular manipulators from high-level task specifications. 
			In the first part of the project, our approach handles tasks of the type pick-and-place,
			meaning that the manipulator should be able to reach a set of points in the enviroment
			while avoiding collisions. Our approach is able
			to handle partially infeasible tasks by either identifying the
			infeasible part and finding a design that satisfies the feasible
			part or searching for multiple designs that together satisfy the
			entire task. This work was presented at ICRA 2019, entitled "Task-Based Design of Ad-hoc Modular Manipulators".

			<p>
			In the second part of the project, we focused on continuous tasks around of obstacles. 
			In this type of task, the manipulator is required to, accurately, follow a 
			specified trajectory, such as paint a drawing or wiping off a table.

		<h3>Satisfiability Modulo Theories-Based Feedback and Control for Social Navigation </h3>
		    <p>
			    In this work, we focused on developing a control paradigm for social navigation. We formulated the problem as 
			    a set of constraints on the robot motion using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formulas,
			    and synthesize robot control that is guaranteed to be safe and correct. 
			    Due to its use of high-level formal specifications, the controller is able 
			    to provide feedback to the user in situations where human behavior causes the robot to fail. 
			    This feedback allows the human to adjust their behavior and recover joint navigation.
			    This work was presented at ICRA 2019 entitled "SMT-Based Feedback and Control for Social Navigation".
